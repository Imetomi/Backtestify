# Backtestify

A simple backtest library to simulate real world trading. 

## Why another backtest library?

**Backtestify** takes spread into account while simulating your strategy. Most of the backtesting libraries out there tend to generate false profit caused by the lack of spread. **Backtestify** uses real historical data from Oanda.com, but you can use your own dataset based on the input requirements.

## Main Features 

1. Placing long and short postiions in a simple way.
2. Take profit and stop loss.
